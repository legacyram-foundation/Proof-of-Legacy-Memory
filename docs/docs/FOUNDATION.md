# LegacyRAM Foundation

The LegacyRAM Foundation exists to guide the early research
and development of the Proof of Legacy Memory protocol.

The foundation does not control the network.

Its purpose is to support open development,
community participation, and long-term protocol stability.

Founder:
Aluísio Fernandes (Aluminium)

Future governance will transition toward
community-driven decentralized coordination.
