# Proof of Legacy Memory (PoLM)

Proof of Legacy Memory (PoLM) is a new consensus and computation model designed to favor latency-bound memory access instead of raw parallel processing power.

## Vision

Modern computation increasingly excludes older hardware due to GPU and massive parallelism requirements.

PoLM reverses this paradigm.

Instead of rewarding parallel throughput, PoLM rewards:

- Sequential memory access
- Latency stability
- Cache limitations
- Deterministic execution paths

This allows legacy machines to remain computationally competitive.

## Core Concept

The algorithm intentionally:

- Breaks GPU parallelism
- Penalizes large cache prediction
- Requires sequential dependency chains
- Uses latency-sensitive workloads

Older CPUs become viable nodes again.

## Goals

- Democratize distributed computation
- Reduce electronic waste
- Enable participation using legacy hardware
- Create inclusive decentralized infrastructure
