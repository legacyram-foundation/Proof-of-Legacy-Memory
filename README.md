# Proof of Legacy Memory (PoLM)

Proof of Legacy Memory (PoLM) is a latency-bound consensus and computation model designed to restore computational relevance to legacy hardware.

Unlike modern proof systems optimized for massive parallelism and GPU acceleration, PoLM intentionally favors sequential memory access and latency-dependent execution.

---

## Philosophy

Modern distributed systems increasingly centralize computational power around specialized hardware.

PoLM introduces a different approach:

> Computation should reward persistence, stability, and accessibility — not hardware privilege.

Legacy machines become first-class participants again.

## Core Principles

PoLM workloads are intentionally designed to:

- Require slow sequential memory access
- Limit effective parallel execution
- Depend on real memory latency
- Reduce cache prediction advantages
- Penalize GPU-style throughput optimization

This creates a computation environment where older CPUs remain competitive.

## Objectives

- Democratize decentralized computation
- Extend usable life of legacy hardware
- Reduce electronic waste
- Enable global participation without specialized equipment
- Research latency-based consensus systems
